**ὀδύσαντο**: 3rd person pl. unaugmented aor. ὀδύσσομαι, with
the dative *τῷ*. The verb *ὀδύσσομαι* is identified by LSJ as the
'mythic origin' of Odysseus' name, from Od. 19.407, in which Odysseus'
grandfather Autolycus tells Eurycleia, who will go on to raise him, what
his name should be: *πολλοῖσιν γὰρ ἐγώ γε ὀδυσσάμενος τόδ᾽ ἱκάνω, /
ἀνδράσιν ἠδὲ γυναιξὶν ἀνὰ χθόνα πουλυβότειραν: / τῷ δ᾽ Ὀδυσεὺς ὄνομ᾽
ἔστω ἐπώνυμον,* "For indeed I come having been angered by many people,
men and women, throughout the all-nourishing earth; and therefore let
his name, fittingly, be Odysseus."

**ῥεῖα**: adverbial form of ῥᾴδιος; "easily/pleasantly." The inclusion
of *ῥεῖα ζώοντες*, according to Graziosi & Haubold, suggests the
inefficacy of Lycurgus' attack on the Maenads in the mountains of Nysa,
and contrasts the carefree life of the gods with the miserable lives of
men (p. 115).

**τυφλὸν**: "blind," the only appearance of the word in Homer. Can
also be used metaphorically, or to refer to things which are hidden or
obscured. Has the English cognate *typhlosis*, the technical term for
blindness in the field of pathology. LSJ notes that *τυφλός* may be
connected to the Old English word *déaf* meaning "stupid," and/or the
Old Irish word *dub* meaning "black."

**Κρόνου πάϊς**: i.e. Zeus.

**οὐδ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἔτι δὴν ἦν**: "Indeed he did not live long hereafter." *ἔτι*:
adverb with the most common meanings "yet" or "still," but with *δὴν*
carries the sense of "\[for\] much longer."

**ἐπεὶ**: correption; scans as two short syllables, forming a
perfectly dactylic line.

**ἀπήχθετο**: 3rd person sg. imperfect middle *ἀπέχθομαι* /
*ἀπεχθάνομαι*, which can be accompanied by a person in the dative case.

**ἐθέλοιμι**: 1st person sg. present optative. A potential optative,
one of the independent uses of the optative mood, accompanied by *ἄν* or
*κέν*. Reinforces the sentiment in line 129, *οὐκ ἂν ἔγωγε θεοῖσιν
ἐπουρανίοισι μαχοίμην*, "I would not fight the heavenly gods."
*μαχοίμην* is the present optative in the apodosis of a mixed condition,
with the perfect indicative in the protasis, *εἰλήλουθας*, from
*ἔρχομαι* (line 128). The two similar statements bracket Diomedes' story
of Lycurgus, which is presented partly as an example of why it is
dangerous to challenge the gods. Byron Harries points out the
similarities between the language used by Diomedes in his story of
Lycurgus and the rest of the Iliad, such as the verbs *σεύω* and *θείνω*
for pursuing and attacking enemies, and *κρατερὸς τρόμος* for the fear
felt in battle

**λὰξ**: adverb, "with the foot"

**ἔνθορεν**: third person sg. aorist active indicative *θρῴσκω*

**ἀφραδίῃσιν**: feminine pl. *ἀφραδία*, dative of cause; "out of
thoughtlessness." Contains the negated root of *φράζω*, which, in the
middle or passive voice, literally means 'to point out/indicate to
oneself,' and so, metaphorically, 'to reflect.' Used exclusively in the
dative plural in Homer, according to LSJ. Deborah Steiner notes that the
word is often used in situations where someone's thoughtlessness
ultimately brings misfortune upon them, e.g. in 9.361, where Odysseus
says *τρὶς μὲν ἔδωκα φέρων, τρὶς δ᾽ ἔκπιεν ἀφραδίῃσιν*, "I brought
\[wine\] and gave it to him three times, and three times he drank it
fully in his folly." In the same way that Polyphemus' 'thoughtlessness'
leads to his defeat by Odysseus, this scene perhaps foreshadows
Melanthius' demise: "They led Melanthius through the door and the
courtyard, and they cut off his nose and ears with ruthless bronze, and
pulled out his genitals, for the dogs to eat raw... and the deed was
done" (*ἐκ δὲ Μελάνθιον ἦγον ἀνὰ πρόθυρόν τε καὶ αὐλήν: / τοῦ δ᾽ ἀπὸ μὲν
ῥῖνάς τε καὶ οὔατα νηλέϊ χαλκῷ / τάμνον, μήδεά τ᾽ ἐξέρυσαν, κυσὶν ὠμὰ
δάσασθαι... /... τετέλεστο δὲ ἔργον*, Od. 18.474-478). This punishment
is especially brutal; *ἀφραδία* is perhaps used to characterize someone
who makes a critical error or commits a serious transgression, not just
a silly mistake. The English translation of *ἀφραδία* as 'folly,' then,
may not fully allow the serious connotations of the Greek word to come
through.

**ἰσχίῳ**: neuter sg. *ἴσχιον*, dative of location.

---

@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:17.235


**ἔμεν᾽ ἀσφαλέως**: "remained unmoveable/steady." *ἀσφαλέως* is an
adverb which here identifies the condition which Odysseus *remained* in,
but the physical sense of remaining in one spot is also relevant in this
context, and the adverb itself carries the sense of being grounded in
place.

**μερμήριξεν**: third person sg. aorist active indicative *μερμηρίζω*,
related to *μέρμηρα*, 'care/trouble' or perhaps to the verb *μερίζομαι*,
"to be divided" (LSJ).

@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:17.236

**ἠὲ...ἦ**: Correlative conjunctions expressing the two options
being weighed by Odysseus, of which he ultimately chooses neither.
Steiner notes that when two options are presented in this way, the
common outcome is that the second is chosen, but here Odysseus instead
decides on a third, non-violent, course of action. This demonstrates his
self-restraint, which is especially necessary while he is still in
disguise, as well as his ability to 'suffer and endure' (109).

**ἕλοιτο**: third person sg. aorist optative *αἱρέω*, replacing a
deliberative subjunctive in secondary sequence.

---

@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:17.237

**κάρη**: neuter accusative pl. *κάρα*, object of *ἐλάσειε*, also
optative in secondary sequence replacing the subjunctive.

**ἀείρας**: "having lifted \[him\] up," masculine nominative singular
aorist active participle of *ἀείρω*, which appears as *αἴρω* in Attic
Greek.

**235** **αἲ γάρ, Ζεῦ τε πάτερ καὶ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Ἄπολλον**: "I wish,
father Zeus, and Athena and Apollo, (that)\..." A line introducing a
wish, addressed to the gods in the vocative case. Each *και* scans short
(epic correption). This line appears word for word elsewhere, such as in
Od. 17.133-136, where Telemachus tells Penelope what Menelaus had said
to him in Sparta, that he wished Penelope's suitors would be punished by
Odysseus. According to Deborah Steiner, this expression is often used
when the wish contains a comparison, as here between how Odysseus has
handled Irus and how Telemachus wishes he would deal with the suitors,
and in the example from Book 17 in which Menelaus fantasizes about
Odysseus being the same kind of man as he was when he "stood up and
wrestled with Philomeleides, and threw him mightily" (*Φιλομηλεΐδῃ
ἐπάλαισεν ἀναστάς, κὰδ δ᾽ ἔβαλε κρατερῶς*, 134-35).

**236** **οὕτω**: Referencing the preceding lines, 233-34, which
describe how the 'stranger' defeated the wanderer Irus. Telemachus
expressing his wish to his mother, that the suitors would be overpowered
by Odysseus in the same way that Irus has been overpowered by the
stranger, is a nod to the listeners, as Telemachus knows that the
stranger is Odysseus himself. Similarly, he says in line 232 that he
"has no allies" (*ἐμοὶ δ᾽ οὐκ εἰσὶν ἀρωγοί*), which would appear to
Penelope to be true, whereas the listeners of the story, and Telemachus
himself, know that his father is present.

**237 νεύοιεν**: third person plural present active *νεύω*, optative of
wish.

**οἱ μὲν ἐν αὐλῇ, οἱ δ᾽ ἔντοσθε δόμοιο**: "some in the courtyard, others
inside the house," with the contrast signified by the correlatives *μέν*
and *δέ*.

---

@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:18.238

**238 λελῦτο**: third person singular perfect passive optative of *λύω*;
singular verb with a neuter plural subject (Smyth §958).

---

@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:18.240

**240** **νευστάζων**: masculine singular nominative participle of
*νευστάζω*, here used intransitively with the dative of instrument
*κεφαλῇ*, as opposed to *νεύω* in line 237 which takes the direct object
*κεφαλὰς.*

---

@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:18.242

**242** **φίλα γυῖα**: "his limbs," with the adjective *φίλος*
indicating possession.

**λέλυνται**: third person plural perfect passive indicative of *λύω*.
The neuter plural subject *γυῖα* takes a plural verb, despite the same
noun being accompanied by a singular verb in line 238, possibly because
the plural is better suited to the meter than the singular in line 242
(and the singular is necessary for the meter in 238) (see Smyth §959a).
