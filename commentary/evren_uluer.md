**[ἥτε](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=h%28%2Fte&la=greek&can=h%28%2Fte0):**
A combination of the first singular feminen personal pronoun and the
post-positive conjunction.
[**τε**](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=h%28%2Fte&la=greek&can=h%28%2Fte0)
is usually coordinating two nouns or adjectives but here it is acting as
a coordinating conjunction.

**[εἴργηται](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ei%29%2Frghtai&la=greek&can=ei%29%2Frghtai0&prior=to/koio):**
Note the enjambment here. Demeter is quite literally cut off from the
gifts of Aphrodite; the personal pronoun referencing her is stranded on
the line before the descriptions of her former beauty.

**[δώρων](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=dw%2Frwn&la=greek&can=dw%2Frwn0)
[τε](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=te&la=greek&can=te1&prior=dw/rwn)
[φιλοστεφάνου](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=filostefa%2Fnou&la=greek&can=filostefa%2Fnou0&prior=te):**
The gifts and loving-garland of Athena is a stand in for Aphrodite's
beauty.

**θεμιστοπόλων:** This word appears only two times in ancient
literature, coming from the goddess of law and order --- Themis.

**ταμίαι
[κατὰ](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=kata%5C&la=greek&can=kata%5C0&prior=tami/ai)
[δώματα](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=dw%2Fmata&la=greek&can=dw%2Fmata0&prior=kata%5C)
[ἠχήεντα](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=h%29xh%2Fenta&la=greek&can=h%29xh%2Fenta0&prior=dw/mata):**
Demeter is described like a maid in a
[**ἠχήεντα**](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=h%29xh%2Fenta&la=greek&can=h%29xh%2Fenta0&prior=dw/mata)
home. She is wandering through 'echoing' halls. This implies an empty
home, as she is wandering the Earth searching for her daughter with no
one by her side.

This line scans irregularly in dactylic hexameter. Most of the
time in Homer a line will end with a dactyl then a spondee, but here it
ends with two spondees. This is done to emphasize the echoing halls with
a slower more deliberate end to the line.
