**αἳ** is a feminine nominative plural relative pronoun, which refers
back to τιθήνας, the nymphs and nurses of Dionysus, in line 132.

**θύσθλα** are the instruments used in Bacchic revelries for worship or
sacrifice, including thyrsi and torches. Lycurgus is intruding on a
ritual being held by the attendants of Dionysus, part of a myth that
first appears here from what remains to us.

**χαμαὶ** is an adverb meaning 'on the ground'. Typically, this word is
used in the context of weapons or body parts falling to the ground after
someone has been struck, as seen in 5.582-3, 13.529-30, and 15.578
(Graziosi and Haubold, 2010).

**ὑπʼ** is the elided version of ὑπό, a preposition taking the genitive
of cause here. It modifies Λυκούργου.

**ἀνδροφόνοιο** is a Homeric genitive, and the adjective modifies
Lycurgus. This adjective, which means 'man killer', usually is
attributed to warriors or heroes like Hector, while Lycurgus is
attempting to kill a god and his female attendants in this story
(Graziosi and Haubold, 2010). Characterizing Lycurgus in this way,
coupled by χαμαὶ, Diomedes presents Lycurgus as someone who has lost his
φρήν. His actions are against the natural order and hubristic. A myth
like this would indicate to an ancient audience the importance of
respecting the divine, and what the eventual consequences would be for
this hubris. In this context, some argue that Diomedes is telling this
myth to show his restraint in the face of an unknown foe (Fineberg,
1999). He does not want to make the mistake of inadvertently attacking a
god. This passage also can be juxtaposed to the beginning of Book 6,
wherein somewhat senseless and wild murder is taking place, evoking a
loss of φρήν. The dissolution of φρήν by Lycurgus can be compared to
Glaucus seemingly giving up too much in his exchange with Diomedes;
however, as Walter Donlan discusses, this gift exchange by Glaucus was
likely from acknowledging ξενία and Diomedes' superiority instead
(1989).

**βουπλῆγι** is a dative of instrument: 'with an ox-goad.' Βουπλήξ is
possibly created by the combination of βοῦς and πλήσσω. This tool is
likely being used, as Dionysus is often described with characteristics
of a βοῦς (Graziosi and Haubold, 2010). Regardless, the word choice
continues this unsettling narrative of a man attacking the divine
hubristically.

**κὰδ δ᾽ ἔπεσ᾽** and **σὺν δ᾽ ἤλασ᾽** are two examples of tmesis, coming
from the verbs καταπίπτω and συνελαύνω respectively. These words do not
need to be joined, but the choice of splitting them evokes a sense of
brokenness in Irus. He is not just physically broken, based on the words
themselves, but his character and last morsel of confidence are gone now
too.

**μακών** is a nominative singular masculine aorist active participle of
μηκάομαι. This verb is characteristic of a bleating goat or a dying
animal (Steiner, 2010). Irus is depicted as subhuman and bestial in the
eyes of the suitors. Given how Irus insulted Odysseus at the beginning
of book 18, Odysseus could be thinking this as well.

**σὺν δ᾽ ἤλασ᾽ ὀδόντας** could mean either "he grinded his teeth" or "he
knocked his teeth together," as Steiner (2010) points out. The former
fits in with the preceding and following words, as it emphasizes this
state of pain and anguish for Irus. The latter may work better
grammatically, since it is an aorist indicative in between the aorist
and present participles. By using an indicative, Homer could be focusing
on an additional action, presumably losing teeth, that may have led to
Irus kicking his feet in pain.

**ἀγαυοὶ** is a typical adjective used to describe the suitors. While it
means "noble," it likely refers to the status of the suitors in
comparison to the lowly Irus, rather than the modern connotation of
people with strong moral qualities.

**χεῖρας ἀνασχόμενοι** is the same phrase used in lines 89 and 95,
though in 95, χεῖρας is implied. This juxtaposition stands out, as the
suitors are not the ones fighting. They have, nonetheless, taken an
active role in the beginning of book 18 in starting the fight by
coercing both men to fight for a place in their society and by forcing
Irus into the ring. Steiner (2010) suggests that this action is
consistent with people that prefer to consume goods that are not their
own.

**γέλωι ἔκθανον** means that the suitors "died by means of laughter"
verbatim. This phrase is not meant to be taken literally at this point
of the *Odyssey*, and it instead mirrors the phrase we use today
(Steiner, 2010). While Homer is likely the earliest poet or author
remaining that uses this phrase, he was not the only one. For example,
Diogenes Laertius, who lived in the 3^rd^ century CE, wrote about how
Chrysippus, living in the 3^rd^ century BCE, died from violently
laughing (Laertius, 7.185). Although this example may need to be taken
as reality, it shows that this was a common enough idea for ancient
peoples as a joke or otherwise. In the *Odyssey*, laughing is typically
used to show weakness and a lack of self-control in characters. Colakis
(1986) brings up various examples, but notably Odysseus himself laughs
at the Cyclops (9.413-414), and the suitors first laugh at Telemachus
before his voyage (2.301 and 2.323) and later towards their end
(20.345-362). Each time, those that laugh bring upon themselves
suffering because of their arrogance, represented by their laughter. In
comparison, characters that replace laughter with a smile in Homer are
typically expressing "superiority, conciliation, or affection" (Levine,
1982). Nevertheless, laughter is not always a negative in Homer. In the
*Iliad*, when Hector is speaking to Andromache before leaving for
battle, they both laugh at their child's cries as a release of emotions
(6.471). This moment appears to be a happy one, not like the negative
instances throughout the *Odyssey*.

**τούτοισι πάντεσσι** make reference to the suitors, whom Odysseus does
not directly name in the speech to his house servants. Since many of the
servants do not recognize Oydsseus, he likely is also indirectly
speaking of their future realization.

**φάος** is an instance of irony by Odysseus (Steiner, 2010). Steiner
writes how **φάος** can be used in a military sense for a victory.
Odysseus bringing light to the suitors and the servants foreshadows his
reveal to them as the glorious, returning hero in Book 21. This
statement contrasts with what Odysseus has tried to accomplish
throughout the entire epic: to hide his true nature.

**εἴ γάρ ἐθέλωσιν**... **νικήσουσι** is a future more vivid conditional
construction with a present active subjunctive in the protasis and a
future active indicative in the apodosis. The construction **εἴ γάρ**
could mean "if only" when used with an optative, indicating wish. In
this case, it is employed with a subjunctive and introduces a condition
instead of an independent use of the optative.

**νικήσουσι** shares the connotation of **φάος** from line 317. The
light from Odysseus will soon come when he proves to be unbeatable in
front of the suitors and servants. Steiner (2010) suggests this word,
common in athletic contexts, is used to meld class-roles here, while the
two parties discuss a household chore. **νικήσουσι**, as an athletic
term, also seems to foretell a victory for Odysseus in the competition
set up by Penelope, an impossible feat for normal men.

**πολυτλήμων εἰμί** is a pointed reference to a common epithet for
Odysseus, πολύτας, contributing to the standard epic formula for ancient
bards (Steiner, 2010). For the audience, this is an obvious indicator of
who is speaking, but the servants know nothing of what this stranger has
endured. They may know stories from the Trojan War of their master, but
Odysseus has not yet completely removed his guise as he tries to
distinguish who he can trust. Directly mentioning one's own epithet is
not an uncommon technique by characters in Homer. Earlier in this book,
Telemachus uses the word πεπνυμένα when telling his mother what he does
not know well (18.230). One of Telemachus' standard epithets is
πεπνυμένος. Although in this instance he is claiming he is not all-wise,
to recognize and admit what you do not know can be considered wise.
Nevertheless, these are two instances of Homeric characters being
self-aware, as if a nod to the audience.
