This line sets in motion a trend for Greek poets. This trend is
called the "Generation of Leaves." These poems tend to be characterized
by content regarding plants, nature, and fitting into the metaphor of
"Humans are Plants" (Milenovic 2019) alongside the idea of human life
being fleeting/eternally renewed. Graziosi and Haubold point out that
Simonides is the first to quote this line directly (fr. 19.1-5).
Simonides says it is the best thing the Chian poet has ever said.
Similarly, Mimnernus makes an allusion to it in Fr. 1, 2. Campbell in
his commentary indicates that Homer focuses on the transience of human
life from each generation to the next, while Mimnermus focuses on
brevity of life in individuals (1999, 226; Graziosi and Haubold 2010,
117).

As for a brief comment on grammar, Graziosi and Haubold tells us that
this line can stand on its own with οἵη being picked up by τοίη.
Οἵη...τοίη... sometimes can be hard to translate, but if they are taken
as correlatives setting up a sort of simile of sorts for instance
"Such...As..." A more literal translation might read "These of men,
which are just as the generations of leaves."

These next two discuss the seasons.. The first half of line
147 "φύλλα τὰ μέν τʼ ἄνεμος χαμάδις χέει" points towards a fall or
autumn season. The Wind blows the leaves to the ground as it does in the
fall. Then in the second half, following into the next line--a form of
enjambment--, the wood, ὕλη, continues to grow leaves after. This
description points to a season of spring where the leaves return. Then
it ends with the notion that spring comes again and again.

The enjambment mentioned above, shows us grammatically and visually the
message of these lines. The wood lasts and remains after the leaves,
continuing to grow. Here the wood is the last to remain continuing on
into the next line, as the message tells us.

ἔαρος comes from ἔαρ, which has two entries in the LSJ. One is glossed
as "Spring" and the other is glossed as "Blood, or Juice" which as a
moisture can be associated with living, growth, and spring (Pilz 2019;
Milenkovic 2019). Although later than Homer, Emily Gowers discusses the
similarities and overlap of the metaphor Trees and People and People are
Trees in Ovid's *Metamorphoses*. She explores the imagery and bleeding
of trees and people changing into trees, concluding the trees are
actually foils to human urban development with the eternal renewal of
trees pushing human progress (Gowers 2023).

| The wife of Proitus, divine Anteia desired\
| To have sex with him in secret love; but in no way
| She persuaded fiery Bellerophon, thinking good thoughts.\
| So, she lying called out to King Proitos:
| May you die, O Proitos, unless you kill Bellerophon,
| Who wished in love to have sex with unwilling me.

Overall, this scene outlines part of the Bellerophon myth, where he came
to Argos seeking purification for muder from Proitos. However, Anteia,
wife of Proitos, desired Bellerophon and wanted to have sex with him
(*IL.* 6.160-1) . But Bellerophon, as Homer illustrates, does not and
refuses her (*IL* 6.161-2). But then, in response Anteia lies to her
husband, Proitos, saying that Bellerophon tried to seduce her (*IL*
6.163-5). In the lines after this, Proitos gets angry and instead of
killing him directly he sends him to his brother in Lycia asking him to
kill Bellerophon (*IL*. 6.166-6.177).

This story reminds me of the myth of Phaedra. Phaedra, wife of Theseus,
falls in love with Hippolytus, her step-son. Euripides in his play
*Hippolytus* says that she is cursed by Aphrodite, while in Seneca's
version, *Phaedra*, she is more self-aware/self-acting. Then regardless
of versions, she goes mad lusting after him. Hippolytus, like
Bellerophon, refuses Phaedra, not because he is "thinking good thoughts"
(*IL* 6.163) like Bellerophon, but rather because he swore to keep his
chastity to Artemis. Then finally, the myth ends with Phaedra committing
suicide, since she cannot restrain her desire. In some versions of the
myth, like Seneca's, Theseus reads a letter from Phaedra, where she
accuses Hippolytus of seducing and assaulting her. Then in ire, Theseus
swears to Poseidon to kill Hippolytus for his crimes, which Poseidon
does. After these deaths, Theseus learns the truth of Phaedra's desire,
and ends up grieving both.

As both myths are outlined above, we can see some parallels. Both myths
have a lust driven queen, both have the male son or son-like figure
refuse, both women accuse the son of seducing and assaulting them,
causing a punishment of death for both men. In the end of the myths,
Bellerophon manages to avoid death by completing the trials set out by
the king of Lycia, and Hippolytus is not able to escape death. Only
Phaedra dies, while Anteia lives. Another difference is how the
accusation is carried out, Anteia asks Proitos directly, and Phaedra
accuses via a letter. To me, this difference in accusation and
death/life is meant to make us feel sympathy or not. In Phaedra's case,
her death leads us to think she is a victim of circumstances that she
cannot/does not know how to cope with her desire for Hippolytus. She
feels so overwhelmed the only solution she finds is death and a letter
of accusation. However, for Anteia, she not only still lives, but
directly asks Proitos. To me this difference reads Anteia as jealous and
unhappy or even enraged that she cannot get what she wants, in this
instance Bellerophon. Her jealousy and her living makes her an
unsympathetic and untragic character, acting only for herself. Graziousi
and Haubold make a similar observation. These myths play on the greater
myth motif: "a married woman tries to seduce a man of lower standing,
fails and accuses him of having tried to seduce her" (122). They go
further saying that these myths typically involve divine justice--i.e.
The god/gods are on the men of lower standing (Graziouse and Haubold
2010, 122). Their last observations,\
\
Generally the grammar in this passage is fairly straight forward, but
there are few interesting things.

**ἐπεμήνατο:** there is some interesting imagery looking at this
line, and what Anteia reports to be happening. Here the meaning of the
word is "desire," "passion," or even "lust." Then, if we compare it to
what Anteia reports, she swaps ἐπεμήνατο with ἔθελεν (cf. ln. 165).
Ἐθέλω carries a different meaning one of wishing or want, but distinctly
not desire. It still carries a similar meaning, but as outlined above it
is different. This distinction leads to some interesting imagery. Anteia
has a "desire" for Bellerophon, while Bellerophon supposedly "wants" or
"wishes" μιγήμεναι. This shows a clear distinction between the
motivations of the two. The desire of Anteia is uncontrollable like
Phaedra in my discussion above.

**μιγήμεναι:** This is an aorist passive infinitive. There is some
interesting imagery here. It calls to mind the ideas of marriage in
ancient Greece, where the woman is given to the husband. The marriage is
in the passive voice, the woman has no agency (cf. *IL*. 6.192 for a
marriage scene). Here the passive infinitive could reflect that idea,
she is passive in her actions of making love. This idea is nicely
juxtaposed with Anteia doing the actions, despite her receiving the
love.

@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.163

**ἢ:** Normally, here this should be translated as "or," but in this
case, if want to retain Greek word order, translate it as an "Unless."
**κάκτανε:** this word here is parsed as a 3 S Aor. Act. Ind. but
carries a force of the imperative. So it is better to translate it as
"you kill him."

---

@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.165

**μιγήμεναι:** This word appears in the same form and position as
it appears in line 161(cf. n. 161, cf. Graziosi and Haubold for
discussion of position n. 161, pg. 123). Here the same idea applies.
Bellerophon is the one wishing, but the complementary infinitive is in
the passive. So Bellerophon is "receiving" the love, since we know that
Anteia is the one desiring Bellerophon, this imagery creates some nice
juxtaposition in the scene. Anteia desires, but receives as a woman does
in marriage, then ends with Bellerophon "wishes," but receives the love,
here from Anteia. Of course, for this note, and n. 161, this
construction with the passive infinitive is the typical construction,
thus this is reading too far into it. Graziousi and Haubold seem to
indicate that (see their note 161 pg. 123). **μʼ:** I read this as a με
like MS Z West, but Graziousi and Haubold read it as μοι making the
participle at the end of the line--ἐθελούσῃ--agree with μοι rather than
φιλότητι, which here is more like a dative of mean/manner (cf. their
note 165 pg. 123 for a longer discussion).

| Wise Penelope came from the inner room,
| Looking like Artemis or golden Aphrodite,
| She, crying, threw her arms around her dear child,
| She kissed his head and both of his beautiful eyes.
| And she lamented and spoke winged-words:

For convenience *Ody*. 4.120-122:

| ἧος ὁ ταῦθʼ ὥρμαινε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν,
| ἐκ δʼ Ἑλένη θαλάμοιο θυώδεος ὑψορόφοιο
| ἤλυθεν Ἀρτέμιδι χρυσηλακάτῳ ἐικυῖα.

| While he(Menelaos) was debating this throughout his mind and heart,
| From the high-roofed sweet-smelling bedchamber Helen
| Came looking like Artemis with the golden arrow.

These two lines echo an earlier scene in the *Odyssey*.
Steiner notes that in addition to her beauty this description is playing
on the two aspects of Penelope. The chaste through Artemis and "nubile
maiden ready for (re)marriage" through Aphrodite (2010, 80). She
compares Penelope with Nausica in an earlier scene, referencing
Nausica's chaste nature and Odysseus' address (Steiner 2010, 80). In
addition to those scenes, there is another comparison of a female
character with a Goddess. It is Helen with Artemis, a surprising
comparison given Helen's reputation in the Iliad of unchaste unlike
Penelope (*Ody*. 4.120-122). The similarities between these two scenes
does not end with this comparison alone. Like Penelope in this scene,
Helen is coming down from her room--both use θάλαμος, and interact with
Telemachus in some way before speaking (*Ody*. 4.120-122). This
similarity could be used to highlight the gender roles these women are
trying to occupy. For Penelope, Artemis represents her more "womanly"
affairs like weaving, which she does throughout the *Odyssey*, but also
later in this book (cf. *Ody*. 17.97). While her Aphrodite aspect,
highlights her beauty as Steiner suggests (2010, 80). Helen in her
comparison to Artemis, also, weaves later in the scene (cf. *Ody*.
4.132-136). This could be a way for Helen to reclaim her "womanly"
nature or rather the "traditional" one, but this is not the place for
this discussion. As for differences, the θάλαμος is one of the first. In
Penelope's case the θάλαμος is left undescribed, while Helen's θάλαμος
is described as θυώδεος ὑψορόφοιο (*Ody*. 4.121). Perhaps Helen's room
is described as such because of a greater wealth, and because of Helen's
magical drugs, since smell, drugs, and magic are all associated (*Ody*.
4.220; Ager 2019). Another difference is Helen's entrance has
enjambment; the verb is in the next line (*Ody*. 4.120-121), whereas
Penelope fully enters in the same line; Her relation to the goddesses is
all on its own. This difference could be for metrical convenience, or to
emphasize Penelope's divine nature, while downplaying Helen's. These two
women are clearly meant to be seen as foils of each other, there are
numerous discussions on this (Lesser 2019; Steiner 2010, 25-28;
Fredricksmeyer 1997). The double description of Penelope could be
indicating that she is facing a "choice" on whether to remain chaste, or
not to become the new "Helen," leading to another 10 year long war.
Helen's description, as I mentioned above, could then be trying to
regain her "chaste" look, or more "traditional womanly role."

**39**. φάεα here means "eyes", rather than "light," which Steiner notes
the connection between to two in other myths and sources (2010, 80-81).
