**πόποι:** an exclamatory interjection of anger, displeasure or
shock, frequently used in Homer. Although it is a general expression of
distress, it is often used in a mocking or bitterly sarcastic dialogue
or exclamation towards someone else. (cf. *Il*.16.745, *Od*.17.248). The
user of this word is often in a superior position to that who is being
mocked, whether literally or metaphorically. This is the second time
this word is seen in book 17, after Melanthius uses this word before
berating Eumaeus and his position as a slave. Can be taken as "oh
shame," or "alas," but should be translated with an ironic or sardonic
tone. Should be interpreted here as an expression of dramatic
disappointment. **σοί γʼ ἐπὶ εἴδεϊ**: ἐπὶ, when taken with a genitive,
dative, or accusative can be taken as "on" or more fittingly here
"upon/along with." εἴδεϊ: dative singular of εἶδος, meaning "shape, or
form," indicating one's looks or appearance. **φρένες**: nominative
plural of φρήν, literally one's "midriff," but also one's "mind" or
"heart." Odysseus negatively compares Antinous' good physical appearance
with his lack of both intelligence and compassion. Odysseus uses this
comparison earlier in response to Euryalus in 8.168-171, where he says
that the gods do not grant physical and mental gifts equally (οὔτε φυὴν
οὔτʼ ἂρ φρένας οὔτʼ ἀγορητύν). The use of φρένες here is interesting,
and can be contrasted with its identification in book 8. While Odysseus
specifically cites the gods granting μορφὴν ἔπεσι ("\[good\] form to
words") *Od*.8.170) as a remedy to not possessing beautiful εἶδος, in
this rebuke it could be argued that what Antinous lacks here is not
intelligence or eloquence, but rather empathy.

**σῷ ἐπιστάτῃ**: ἐπιστάτης literally means "one who stands near,"
and is also can be compared to ἱκέτης ("suppliant"). Steiner (2010)
suggests a possible translation of "dependent." What this suggests here
is that Antinous not only won't begrudge a crumb to a guest, but also to
anyone who needs him in general. This echoes his lack of φρένες, which
can either be one's mind or "seat of passions" (LSJ, i.e. the "heart").
Antinous selfishness despite his comfortable position is firmly
established. **ἅλα**: "a grain of salt.

**νῦν ἀλλοτρίοισι παρήμενος**: Antinous stinginess is not
restricted to time or situation. Antinous doesn't just sit at someone
else's table, he παρήμενος (LSJ, "sits idly). Odysseus points out
Antinous' hypocrisy. **ἔτλης...δόμεναι**: a low blow. ἔτλης, 2nd person
aorist of τλάω, can mean to both "take something upon one's self," or
"to suffer" or "undergo." The insult is doubled. Antinous is not just
greedy, but he is also lazy and adverse to work. He does not actively
refuse to give to Odysseus, but can't even lift a finger to do so.
σίτου: Genitive of σῖτος ("corn," "grain"). Antinous won't even part
with the smallest bit of the whole bread. A good way to take this would
be "a crumb." **ἀποπροελὼν:** Nominative aorist participle from
ἀποπροαιρέω ("to take away from"). It is important to note that these
crumbs are already taken, not just crumbs from the table in front of
Antinous. Odysseus makes them seem almost locked in Antinous' hands.
Notice how the insult builds upon itself and is strictly focused on
Antinous' physical body to emphasize the shortcomings of his φρήν. At
the end of this 4 line mocking, Odysseus brings the crumbs of grain back
to the physical act of taking them away. One can imagine Antinous' hands
messy, the grains stuck to his palms. This also refers back to Antinous'
inability to take anything upon himself, as he cannot even brush away
the smallest particles of the food he has unjustly helped himself too,
and even if he could, he wouldn't want to. **πολλὰ** **πάρεστιν**:
Odysseus concludes with a final smear that there is plenty of food
present before Antinous.
