| But Hektor, understanding this, knew in his mind and spoke:
| "O alas! Great! Surely indeed the gods have summoned my death:
| For I was thinking that Deiphobus, a hero, was present,
| but he, on one hand, was within the wall, and on the other Athena has tricked me."

This passage details the climactic scene before the death of Hektor by
the hands of Achilles. Shortly before this final confrontation, Achilles
had chased Hektor around the walls of Troy three times. Hektor stops and
sees his brother, Deiphobus, who is ready to arm Hektor with spears to
throw at Achilles. Unbeknownst to Hektor, Athena has disguised herself
as Deiphobus to deceive Hektor and allow Achilles his revenge. Getting
hold of his fears, Hektor plants his feet and faces Achilles, who throws
a spear at Hektor, missing in the process. Assuming he is now unarmed,
Hektor throws his spear only to miss, however he expects his brother,
Deiphobus, to hand him another spear. When Hektor realizes the trick,
and that Athena has returned the thrown spear to Achilles, Hektor
accepts his imminent death. Achilles throws his spear, hitting Hektor
around his neck, leaving Hektor with only a few last words. Hektor begs
for a proper burial but Achilles refuses, seeking justice for Patroclus.
Hektor dies; Achilles strips his armor and drags his dead body around
Troy behind his chariot.

I chose this passage because of a) the context of this being the climax
of the entire book, but also because I personally struggle with trying
to translate particles, adverbs, and conjunctions into English. I do not
know why I find them so challenging but it is something I have
recognized, so this passage was also helpful to see how each were
functioning. I also wanted to look into why Homer uses them, and one
resource I came across was an audio recorded reading of this passage in
its specific meter: <https://hypotactic.com/homer/iliad22.html>. Knowing
how important this moment is in the story I was curious to see how the
bard would have delivered these few lines, and 297 is all dactyls except
for the last measure which is always a spondee. Homer is using these
particles and adverbs to show, audibly, how in distress Hektor is. His
nerves are acting up and he is talking incredibly fast. 296, on the
other hand, is rather slow and builds up this moment of anxiety. 298-9
then return to a slower pace once Hektor accepts that he will soon die.

This is a simple passage in terms of grammar. I think this is purposeful
because again of the visceral reactions the listener is supposed to have
while listening. Hektor's fight or flight senses are off the charts
here, there is no time for complicated thoughts or actions, just pure
adrenaline. This is seen on the opposite side of the coin where people
like Odysseus whose speech is overtly complicated and difficult to
comprehend which show his oratory skills. These stories were not
restricted to any particular class of person since the language and
imagery were so relatable that even today we are able to show empathy to
the characters and moments like this one in book 22.
